# Day 30

## Inspiration

### Steal like an artist

[Dogecoin.com](https://dogecoin.com/) has a great design when I viewed it in landscape mode.
    I'm impressived by website it's design. I opened the developer options shortly after  

    the after pseudo element utilized to make a small right angled triancle next to a box with a slight border radius, creating a word bubble effect.
