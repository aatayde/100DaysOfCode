## JavaScript KWh Charging Calculator

### How do you calculate how much time you need to charge your electric vehicle?

Formula for calculating charge

Power / Storage = Charging Time
`7KW / 28KWh = 4 Hours`

And this can be shown as Power _ Charging Time = Storage
`7KW _ 4 Hours = 28KWh`

### Why make this? Why is it useful?

    I often forget how to calculate charging speeds & I end up rewatching the sames youtube videos on how to calculate charging speeds.

    Calculating charging speeds lets me plan out how much time im going to spend while im out
